### Ticket Assignment
Please assign yourself to a ticket when you start working on it

Also move your ticket into 'In progress'

### Branch Creation
Please please please **CREATE** your working branch **BEFORE** you start coding

Branches should be named like the following: 
1. ```feature``` OR ```bugfix```
2. followed by ```/```
3. followed by your ticket name

Example: ```feature/setup-pages```

### Pull Requests
Please make a pull request before committing to main branch :)

Pull requests need to have 2x approvals. You can follow this template when creating your pull request
